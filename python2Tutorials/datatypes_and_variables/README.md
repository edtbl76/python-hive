#DataTypes and Variables:

    VARIABLE: named reference to a physical memory location
    used by a computer program. In most cases a variable has 4
    components.
    - name
    - scope
    - value
    - type
    
    DECLARATION: binding a variable to a data type
    
    ASSIGNMENT: binding a variable to a value using an 
    assignment operator (which is usually '=')
    
    
  Python is weakly typed, so it doesn't require variable 
  declaration, and unlike strongly-typed languages, the
  data type can change. 
  
      IDENTIFIERS: symbols used to uniquely identify a 
      program element in code (i.e. the components/elements of a 
      variable, class, method, function, etc.) 
      
  Python identifiers must be a non-empty sequence of any 
  length :
  - starting character must be upper/lower letter or underscore
  - following characters can be the same as starting character,
  but digits are allowed as well.
  - CASE SENSITIVE
  - must not be a python keyword.
